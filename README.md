# SpayZee
 Technical exercise in healthy coding & design patterns and state-machines

Spayzee is a simple top-down, 2D arcade-y shooter made to exemplify the use of certain design patterns.

The list of these patterns is compromised by:
* Pool
* Command
* Observer/Observee
* Strategy
* FlyWeight
* State-Machine (Used for the game's boss)
* Model-View-Controller (Used for the player character)
